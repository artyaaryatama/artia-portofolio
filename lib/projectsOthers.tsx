    description: "For my undergraduate thesis, I built a web-based decentralized app (dApp) from scratch using React.js to trace and manage traditional medicine data. The system was designed to streamline Indonesia's BPOM (similar to the FDA) registration process by integrating blockchain and cloud services. I implemented Sepolia (Ethereum Testnet) as the layer for recording transaction data, ensuring tamper-proof and verifiable tracking. To simplify user verification of transaction hashes, I utilized Firebase to store and query hashes for each registration phase, while I leveraged IPFS to upload registration files and manage decentralized storage for unique package identifiers, reinforcing transparency and reliability throughout the workflow.",
