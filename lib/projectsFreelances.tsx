    description: 'During my time as a Frontend Developer at SMA Athirah Bone, I worked on building both the landing page and a custom CMS to manage dynamic content such as news, achievements, teacher data, alumni highlights, facilities, and announcements. I was responsible for designing and developing all key pages, ensuring that the content looked clean, accessible, and easy to update without manual hassle. From crafting the news section to structuring the alumni showcase, I handled the entire frontend process, from design to implementation while integrating Supabase as the backend with its SQL database, built-in authentication, and auto-generated API calls to make content management seamless and scalable.',

    description: "At Cahaya Petshop, I built the UI for a web dashboard that makes it easier to manage all of the store's services such as pet hotel, pet grooming, and pet clinic. A key part of the system is the monitoring feature, where staff can track essential activities like feeding, drinking, temperature, urinate, defacate, and therapy schedules. My focus was on crafting a clean, user-friendly interface, while collaborating with the backend team to connect the frontend with the system's core functionalities.",

    description: 'Together with the UI/UX team and other frontend developers, I worked on developing several key pages for the SIMTARU (Sistem Tata Ruang) website, including the homepage, spatial planning, regulations, publications, partners, and registration. While the site provides a clear call-to-action to download the mobile app, but also acts as an information portal where users can easily access regulations, spatial planning data, official publications, and other related content. My focus was on translating the designs into clean, functional frontend pages that deliver both accessibility and consistency with the app experience.',
