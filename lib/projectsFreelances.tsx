    description: 'During my time here, I developed a landing page and a custom CMS to manage dynamic content, including news, achievements, teacher data, and announcements. I collaborated with a team to design the UI, ensuring a clean, accessible, and user-friendly experience, while independently handling the entire frontend development and deploying the project using Vercel. To handle dynamic content, I integrated Supabase for the backend, making use of its built-in authentication and auto-generated APIs to create a seamless and scalable CMS.',

    description: "At Cahaya Petshop, I built the UI for a web dashboard that makes it easier to manage all of the store's services such as pet hotel, pet grooming, and pet clinic. A key part of the system is the monitoring feature, where staff can track essential activities like feeding, drinking, temperature, urinate, defacate, and therapy schedules. My focus was on crafting a clean, user-friendly interface, while collaborating with the backend team to connect the frontend with the system's core functionalities.",

    description: 'Together with the UI/UX team and other frontend developers, I worked on developing several key pages for the SIMTARU (Sistem Tata Ruang) website, including the homepage, spatial planning, regulations, publications, partners, and registration. While the site provides a clear call-to-action to download the mobile app, but also acts as an information portal where users can easily access regulations, spatial planning data, official publications, and other related content. My focus was on translating the designs into clean, functional frontend pages that deliver both accessibility and consistency with the app experience.',
